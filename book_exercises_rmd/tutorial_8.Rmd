## Learning objectives
* TBD

## Practice problems
* It's a good idea to work through these on your own, but if
you get very stuck, solutions can be found
[here](tutorial_8_solutions.html)

### 1. Q11 pg 322
All membrane potential responses in the following figure
were obtained using an Izhikevich model neuron. Experiment
with the model and reproduce the figure.

### 2. Q3 pg 321
Show that when $b > 0$ the period of oscillations in the
quadratic integrate-and-fire model is:

$$
T = \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}} 
\bigg( 
    \text{atan}(\frac{v_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{b}}) 
   -\text{atan}(\frac{v_{\text{reset}}}{\sqrt{b}})
\bigg)
$$

### 3. Q4 pg 322
Show that when $b < 0$ and $v_\text{reset} > \sqrt{|b|}$ the
period of oscillations in the quadratic integrate-and-fire
model with $v_{peak} = 1$ is:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{|b|}} 
\bigg( 
    \text{ln}(\frac{1 - \sqrt{|b|}}{1 + \sqrt{|b|}}) 
   -\text{ln}(\frac{v_{\text{reset}} - \sqrt{|b|}}{v_{\text{reset}} + \sqrt{|b|}})
\bigg)
$$

### 4. Q9 pg 322
When is the following model equivalent to the
integrate-and-fire model?
$$
\frac{dv}{dt} = I - v - u \\
\frac{du}{dt} = a (b v - u) \\
\text{if } v = 1, \text{then } v \leftarrow 0, u \leftarrow u + d
$$

Create any non-trivial input (e.g., use something like a
square pulse of current that is strong enough to elicit
interesting spiking behaviour from the model), and pass that
input to both the above model and also to an integrate and
fire neuron. We ought to be able to demonstrate that they
respond to this input in the same way, provided some
constraints are met.
