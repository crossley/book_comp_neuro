## Learning objectives
* TBD

* NOTE: Ended up being a lot of calculus review + conductance
  models intro on the white board.

## Practice problems
* It's a good idea to work through these on your own, but if
you get very stuck, solutions can be found
[here](tutorial_5_solutions.html)

### 1
Consider the following dynamical system:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}V(t) = I - g(V(t) - E)
$$

Show that when $I=0$ this system has an equilibrium point at
$V(t) = 0$.

### 2
Set $I > 0$ for all time steps within the middle third of
your simulation and use Euler's method to find the resulting
$V(T)$.

### 3
Consider the following dynamical system:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}V(t) = I + g(V(t) - E)
$$

How does this system compare to the system you investigated
in earlier problems?
