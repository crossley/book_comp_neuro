## Learning objectives
* TBD

* NOTE: Ended up being a lot of calculus etc review

## Practice problems
* It's a good idea to work through these on your own, but if
you get very stuck, solutions can be found
[here](tutorial_4_solutions.html)

## Work on problem set 2
* [Problem set 2](homework_2.html)
