## Discussion and Activities
- Discuss how the concept of derivatives can be observed in
  neuronal signal transmission speed variations.

- Explore the idea of integrals through the total
  neurotransmitter release over a period, using the area

## Derivatives
A derivative represents the rate at which a function is
changing at any point. For example, if you consider the
distance traveled over time, the derivative of this distance
with respect to time gives you the speed. Let's use Python
to visualize a simple function and its derivative to
understand how it represents change.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the function and its derivative
def f(x):
    return x**2

def df_dx(x):
    return 2*x

# Generate x values
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)

# Plot the function and its derivative
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, f(x), label='f(x) = x^2')
plt.plot(x, df_dx(x), label="f'(x) = 2x", linestyle='--')
plt.title('Function and its Derivative')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Practive with  derivatives
Consider the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + x$. Follow the
steps below to explore its derivative.

1. **Sketch the Function:** On graph paper or using a
   graphing software, plot the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2
   + x \) for \( x \) values ranging from -2 to 4. Describe
     the behavior of the function based on your graph.

2. **Predict the Derivative:** Before calculating the
   derivative, discuss in your group where you think the
   function is increasing, decreasing, or has a flat slope
   (inflection points). Predict how these observations might
   reflect on the graph of the derivative.

3. **Calculate the Derivative:** Calculate the derivative of
   the function, \( f'(x) \). \( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 1 \).

4. **Sketch the Derivative:** Plot the derivative on the
   same or a new graph for the same \( x \) values. Compare
   this graph to the original function's graph. How does the
   derivative reflect the behavior of the original function?


## Integrals
An integral calculates the total accumulation of a quantity,
such as the total area under a curve. It's like adding up
infinite slices of a quantity to find the whole. Let's
visualize how integrals represent the area under a curve
using Python.

```{python}
def integrate_f(a, b, N=1000):
    x = np.linspace(a, b, N)
    fx = f(x)
    area = np.sum((b-a)/N * fx)
    return area

# Define the limits
a, b = 0, 10

# Calculate the area under the curve
area_under_curve = integrate_f(a, b)

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.fill_between(x, f(x), where=[(i >= a and i <= b) for i in x], color="skyblue", alpha=0.4, label=f'Area = {area_under_curve:.2f}')
plt.plot(x, f(x), label='f(x) = x^2')
plt.title('Area under the curve')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('f(x)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Practice with integrals:
Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$ as representing some
quantity over time.

1. **Sketch the Function:** Plot the function \( f(x) = x^2
   \) for \( x \) values ranging from 0 to 4. This
   represents the quantity over time.

2. **Estimate the Area:** Without performing actual
   integration, estimate the area under the curve from \( x
   = 0 \) to \( x = 4 \). You can do this by dividing the
   area into shapes (like rectangles or trapezoids) whose
   area you can easily calculate.

3. **Calculate the Area:** Now, calculate the integral of \(
   f(x) \) from 0 to 4 to find the exact area under the
   curve. \( \int_{0}^{4} x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}x^3 \Big|_0^4
   = \frac{64}{3} \).

4. **Compare and Discuss:** Compare your estimated area with
   the calculated area. Discuss the differences and why they
   might exist. What does this area represent in the context
   of the quantity over time?

5. **Real-World Application:** Think of a real-world
   scenario in neuroscience where calculating the total
   amount of a quantity over time (like neurotransmitter
   release) is crucial. Discuss how you would set up the
   integral to calculate this total amount.
