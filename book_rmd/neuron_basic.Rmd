# Simple neuron model

## Leaky integrate and fire

$$
\frac{d}{dt} v(t) = b - v(t) \\
\text{if } v(t) = 1, \text{then } v(t) \leftarrow 0
$$

* Linearly adds up inputs until the membrane potential
crosses a threshold, at which point a spike is triggered,
and the membrane potential is reset.

* Spikes are all-or-none assumed to be identical in size and
duration.

* Spikes aren't actually part of the stimulation. They are
just hand drawn in when threshold is crossed.
 
* There can be something of a refractory period if the reset
potential is set to hyperpolarize the membrane potential.

* The amplitude of an input is linearly encoded into the
frequency of spiking. This is called **Class 1
excitability**.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

T = 90
tau = 0.01
t = np.arange(0, T, tau)
n = t.shape[0]

v = np.zeros(n)

b = np.concatenate(([0.0] * (t.shape[0] // 3),
                    [1.001] * (t.shape[0] // 3),
                    [0.0] * (t.shape[0] // 3)))
                    
for i in range(1, n):
  
  dvdt = b[i-1] - v[i-1]
  dt = t[i] - t[i-1]
  
  v[i] = v[i-1] + dvdt * dt
  
  if v[i] > 1:
    v[i] = 0
    
fig, ax, = plt.subplots(1, 1, squeeze=False)
ax[0, 0].plot(t, v)
ax[0, 0].set_ylabel('v')
ax[0, 0].set_xlabel('t')
plt.show()
```


## Quadratic integrate and fire

$$
\frac{d}{dt} v(t) = b + v^2(t) \\
\text{if } v(t) = v_{\text{peak}},
\text{then } v(t) \leftarrow v_{\text{reset}}
$$

* It is the simplest truly spiking model. That is, they are
the simplest of models in which the upstroke of an action
potential is generated by the differential equations
themselves.

* It basically does all of the things the leaky integrate
and fire neuron does but way better and with none of the
weird issues stemming from hand drawing spikes.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

T = 90
tau = 0.01
t = np.arange(0, T, tau)
n = t.shape[0]

v = np.zeros(n)
vreset = 0
vpeak = 1
v[0] = vreset

b = np.concatenate(([0.0] * (n // 3),
                    [0.02] * (n // 3),
                    [0.0] * (n // 3)))

for i in range(1, t.shape[0]):
  
  dvdt = b[i-1] + v[i-1]**2
  dt = t[i] - t[i-1]
  
  v[i] = v[i-1] + dvdt * dt
  
  if v[i] > vpeak:
    v[i] = vreset

fig, ax, = plt.subplots(1, 1, squeeze=False)
ax[0, 0].plot(t, v)
ax[0, 0].set_ylabel('v')
ax[0, 0].set_xlabel('t')
plt.show()
```


## Izhikevich Neuron

$$
\begin{align}
C \frac{d}{dt} v(t) &= k(v(t) - v_r) (v(t) - v_t) - u(t) + I(t) \\
\frac{d}{dt} u(t) &= a \big(b(v(t) - v_r) - u(t)\big) \\
\text{ if} &\quad v(t) > v_{\text{peak}} \\
\text{ then} &\quad v(t) \leftarrow c, \quad u(t) \leftarrow u(t) + d
\end{align}
$$

* System of two coupled differential equations comprised of
a fast voltage variable $v$ and a slow recovery variable
$u$.

* All slow currents that *modulate* spike generation are
combined in the variable $u$ (e.g., the activation of the
K$^+$ current or inactivation of the Na$^+$ current or their
combination).

* Main advantage over quadratic integrate-and-fire is that
it can capture a wide variety of spiking behaviour (e.g.,
bursting, chattering, etc.) as well as interesting
subthreshold dynamics leading to spikes.

* The parameters $k$ and $b$ can be found when one knows the
neuron's rheobase and input resistance. The rheobase is
roughly the minimal amplitude of continuous current that
causes the membrane potential to reach the depolarization
threshold.

* The sign of $b$ determines whether $u$ is an amplifying
($b < 0$) or a resonant ($b > 0$) variable. In the latter
case, the neuron sags in response to hyperpolarized pulses
of current, peaks in response to depolarized subthreshold
pulses, and produces rebound (postinhibitory) responses.

* The parameter $a$ is the recovery time constant. 

* The spike cutoff value is $v_{\text{peak}}$, and the
voltage reset value is $c$. 

* The parameter $d$ describes the total amount of outward
minus inward currents activated during the spike and
affecting the after-spike behaviour.

* To examine the wide array of behaviours this model can
generate without re-writing many lines of code, it will be
helpful to use the following function:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def izn(shape_params, spike_params, t_params, I):

    (a, b, c, d, k, C) = shape_params
    (vr, vt, vpeak) = spike_params
    (T, tau, t, n) = t_params

    u = np.zeros(n)
    v = np.zeros(n)
    v[0] = vr

    for i in range(1, n):

        dvdt = (k * (v[i - 1] - vr) *
                (v[i - 1] - vt) - u[i - 1] + I[i - 1]) / C
        dudt = a * (b * (v[i - 1] - vr) - u[i - 1])
        dt = t[i] - t[i - 1]

        v[i] = v[i - 1] + dvdt * dt
        u[i] = u[i - 1] + dudt * dt

        if v[i] > vpeak:
            v[i - 1] = vpeak
            v[i] = c
            u[i] = u[i] + d

    return v, u
```

* We can now control what type of neuron behaviour we get
simply by setting the shape and spike parameters as follows.
